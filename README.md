# EVENT-MITRA

Introduction 
Events create opportunities for people to connect with an area, spend time together, celebrate and experience the diversity of cultures and foster creativity and innovation. They allow a community to come alive and provide an opportunity for a destination to showcase its tourism experience and increase economic activity. Events contribute significantly to community building, lifestyle and leisure enhancement, cultural development, volunteer participation, fundraising and economic development. Most importantly, events create a sense of fun and vibrancy, resulting in a strong sense of community connectivity, pride and a sense of place.

Analysis:
	Existing system: - As per my survey in current market there is no online system to take the registrations of any events so event organizers’ waste the time to take the registrations. In current market organizers can add the event in web portal.    
 
	Proposed System: - We will implement your project name.  The purpose of this project is to create “EVENT MITRA”. In this project publisher wants to publish their events and user will take the registration for the event competition. Publisher needs to register and create events. After creating the events any user can see events list and participate. Admin can get the publisher registration list and created events. To implement this project, we will use full stack languages like PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, MySQL. 

Description state of complement of caption project

The publisher who wants to develop and publish an event on this website must first register using the register form. After registration using the registered username and password, they may login and create the event, but participants will not be able to access it until it is authorised by admin. Any user, once allowed, can participate in any event. The administrator of this site has pre-defined a username and password for secure access to the relevant fields. Only the administrator may login; users and participants do not need to register or login.
The posts on this website are published by the publisher. The publishers design the event with a good description and photos for explanation of the rules and regulations, place, dress, fees, and so on. Following that, attendees can apply for activities in which they are interested by completing the necessary information and registering.
